After 8+ years building cloud infrastructure at scale, I'm now pursuing my MEng in AI at Duke. Taking AI from research capabilities to reliable, production-grade deployments.

Previously: Built and managed cloud platforms at Careforth and Signifyd. TA'd cloud security at Harvard for 4+ years. 
Now: Full-time student exploring how to make AI systems that actually work in production.
